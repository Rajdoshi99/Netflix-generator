# NLP Project Scaffold!
A scaffold for deploying dockerized flask applications.
Given a keyword or a prompt, a pre-trained GPT-2 model is fine-tuned to generate brand new movie/tv descriptions. The model has been trained to output the next word/text -it knows exactly where to add spaces because it has learnt these patterns of spaces between chunks of characters– it also knows when to add periods because it has noticed periods at the end of sentences– and similarly is also smart enough to capitalize the first letter of each sentence. This model will aid in the production of some fascinating stories and Netflix descriptions for new series and movies based on previous or present shows and movies, and so on. It can also be used to generate fan theories revolving around different movies, their prequels , sequels and plots for open ended movies.
